* Supply chain analysis/optimzation: Prescription- how much to send to each location, how many employees on each day
* Coupons, discounts & deals: Relationship- Do people buy more if given certain kinds of coupons/deals
* New products: Identification- Do people enjoy the new products? Are our competitors offering something that is causing our customners to churn?

* Supply chain analysis/optimzation: Locations will run out of supplies less often and have less overhead due to unused supplies, will not be overburdened with orders during peak times
* Coupons, discounts & deals: Customers will be more likely to choose us vs. our competitors, and will possible spend more than they previously were due to increased sense of value gained
* New products: Gain new customers and retain current ones. Prevent competitors from churning ours

* Supply chain analysis/optimzation: May over/underfit and send disproportionate supplies to different locations, at a cost. Assumes that there is a regular pattern of supply need. Could test on small subset of locations before expanding.
* Coupons, discounts & deals: May be reducing revenue without gaining any additional benefit. Best tested on customers with lowest spending, to reduce risk of loss
* New products: Development of new product has cost in R&D and marketing. Assumes that new products will always be well received, which is not the case. Could test by only deploying at small number of locations to determine interest
