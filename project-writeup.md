# Expanding in the Restaurant Industry
Nicholas Dell'Aquilo

## Abstract

## Design
The project is designed to aid a restaurant chain in their efforts to expand their business. This concept developed in two different directions where an opportunity could be found: where can a new chain location be opened, and what new items that are offered at other restaurants could be added to the menu? The desired business impact of both of these opportunities is to reach new customers. The ideal, long-term data science solution path will be to create a prescriptive model of where the best place for a new location is, and what new menu item(s) should be added. The impact hypothesis of this model is that it will be able to find the option(s) that either attract the most new customers or generate the most revenue, depending on the priorities of the business.

## Data
The data consists of two tables from New York City's [Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). The [Restaurant Applications](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Open-Restaurant-Applications/pitm-atqc) dataset has ~12,400 rows and 35 columns, detailing descriptive information of restaurants with outdoor seating, including their location and seating size. The [MenuStat](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-MenuStat/qgc5-ecnb) dataset contains ~65,200 rows with 49 columns, describing the nutritional information of items from several different restaurant chains.

## Algorithms
Both datasets were filtered to remove duplicates, null values, and extreme outliers where applicable. Visualizations were created using Tableau to perform a preliminary exploratory data analysis.
