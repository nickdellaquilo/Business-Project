## Business Project Proposal
Nicholas Dell'Aquilo

#### Framing Question

A new restaurant chain wants to expand its business into New York City, and is doing research on the menus of chains currently in business in the city. There are a number of questions to consider about these competitors:

* What are they serving on their menus?
* What are the most and least common types of food available?
* Are there some areas where the market is oversaturated or undersaturated?
* What are the common (therefore, expected by customers) nutrition quantities of an item?

Answering such questions, among others, will allow the restaurant to understand what items they may want to serve at their new location(s), including ways to get an edge on their competitors, such as offering more variety or a healthier version of an item.

#### Data Description

A public dataset of food items offered by [menustat.org](http://menustat.org/#/home). Their description states:

> MenuStat is a free nutritional database of thousands of foods served by the nationâ€™s largest chain restaurants. It aggregates nutrition information posted on restaurant websites since 2012. By sharing restaurant nutrition information in a way that is easy to search and analyze, MenuStat provides a valuable resource for researchers and others interested in the nutritional content of restaurant foods and beverages. *[Source](http://menustat.org/#/about)*

The dataset includes menu items from 96 restaurants, encompassing 12 different food categories, and measurements of 12 different nutrients, collected in 9 separate years. The data is available to download as Excel-ready worksheets, pre-filtered by the previously described features. 

#### Tools

Exploratory data analysis will be done in Excel, as the data is available to be downloaded as a spreadsheet. Visualization will be done in Tableau.

#### MVP Goal

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will aim to demonstrate actionable trends in the dataset, either as a whole or within a specific niche, that could be leveraged to gain an advantage over other restaurant chains. Offering items that are not commonly available, or offering healthier alternatives to certain items, are examples of ways in which these trends could be acted upon.
